# Micro-Market Alpha Engine
### Early Demand Intelligence System

## 🚀 Overview
Micro-Market Alpha Engine is a decision-intelligence system designed to detect **emerging product demand weeks before peak interest**.  
Instead of forecasting sales, it focuses on identifying **acceleration and breakout signals**, where real strategic advantage exists.

The system converts raw trend data into **city-level ACT / WAIT / IGNORE recommendations** via a custom alpha metric.
